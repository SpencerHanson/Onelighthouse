.about-me
  Spencer Hanson is a talented, and highly-motivated Software Engineer. Over the last couple years, he has worked exclusively within the healthcare sector on multiple teams within a Fortune 500 technology company, and a smaller team within a SaaS start-up. Being able to work in so many different environments has given Spencer a unique insight into all parts of the development process. Most importantly, working with such a wide variety of teams has allowed Spencer to work with many different technologies, some of which include Ruby on Rails, JavaScript (Angular, jQuery, React), and Java. Working in a start-up environment gave Spencer the opportunity to work on the front-end of the stack a fair amount as well (HMTL5, CSS). Spencer has shown the ability to pick up on new technologies quickly, which allowed him to start contributing to the success of his team almost immediately. He has a track-record for facing problems head-on, and not being afraid to take on a task that will push him to not only be a better engineer, but a better teammate, communicator and problem-solver.
